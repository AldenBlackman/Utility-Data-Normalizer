# 🔌 Utility Data Standardizer
This project provides a robust, reusable Python toolset for standardizing and analyzing utility usage and demand data from diverse, messy file formats. It supports batch processing, normalization, monthly aggregation, visualization, and export to clean Excel reports—perfect for building a reliable utility data pipeline.

# 🚀 Features
📁 Reads: CSV, Excel, and PDF utility data files

🔍 Cleans: Handles inconsistent column names, units, and time formats

🧠 Normalizes: Converts all data into a standard format (timestamp, usage_kWh, demand_kW, cost_usd, meter_id, etc.)

📊 Analyzes: Aggregates usage and peak demand to monthly level

📈 Visualizes: Bar charts for monthly usage with overlaid peak demand lines

📦 Exports: Creates Excel reports with data + embedded plots

🔁 Batch Processing: Automatically unzips and standardizes a folder of monthly files
